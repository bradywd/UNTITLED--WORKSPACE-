      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> We review outdoor destinations and provides detailed information for our users. 
          Think about the last time you did not know what to do for your weekend. Did you need some ideas for what to do? 
          Once you decided to spend your time outdoors, did you know how long it would take, or what you would need to do to prepare? 
          That is what I do… I provide suggestions for local destinations and provided the information you need to prepare. 
          The type of information we provide is more detailed than just directions or reviews. We provide suggestions for what to wear and what to pack so that our users can have the best experience possible.

        Located near Alta, Wyoming, this trail provides a front row view to the magnificent Grand Tetons. 
        Both trails are located at Teton Canyon Trail Head, Teton Canyon Rd, Driggs, WY 83422.

        The Hike
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally considered a challenging day hike, you have the option of two different trails to reach the final destination. 
        The most well-known of these trails is generally referred to as Huckleberry. 
        This trail extends 7 Miles from trail head to peak and is generally considered a less steep and difficult climb. 
        The second trail, which is called The Face, is 4 miles in length but is considerably steeper. 
        Although any combination of these trails can be used to climb up and down the mountain, it is generally recommended for a hiker to hike up The Face and return down using Huckleberry. 
        This creates a loop of 11 miles with an elevation gain of over 4100 feet. On average this loop can be completed in 7 hours.

        White Clouds

        Located near Clayton, Idaho this hike extends through the beautiful yet rugged terrain of the Sawtooth Mountain Range. 
        The trailhead is located at 4174 Big Boulder Crk, Clayton, ID 83227 and is near the Livingston Mill.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hike
      </p>
      <p>
        This hike is an out and back trail that extends 20.8 miles with an elevation gain of over 4000 feet. Average completion takes around 10 and a half hours. 
        Some people chose to complete the entire hike in a single day, but others might choose to make shorten the hike to 14 miles (2200 feet of elevation gain) and make Walker Lake their destination. 
        No matter how far up the trail you chose to hike, this is an excellent trail to pack in and camp for one or even multiple nights. 
        Four beautiful lakes are a fisher’s paradise, but also make for a breath-taking sight for any explorer.

        Things to Know Before You Camp
      </p>
      <p>
        The trailhead for this hike is a great place to set up camp if you want to arrive the night before and get an early start the next day. There is an outhouse on the premise but don’t expect the same luxury once you begin your hike. There aren’t necessarily designated camping spots once you make it to the lakes, but some stretches of ground make for a lot better spot to set up a tent than others. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to know that this is Bear Country, and you will need to put all your food items and anything else that smells in a bear bag and hang it up a tree each night as you get ready for bed. Remember that a bear bag should be raised 15 feet from the ground and be about 10 feet away from the trunk of the tree. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although some of the camping spots might have fire pits, fires aren’t allowed all times of the year. It is important for you to do your research before you start your hike to see whether the National Forest Service is permitting fires in the area while you will be camping.
