                <p>This hike is an out and back trail that extends 20.8 miles with an elevation gain of over 4000 feet. Average completion takes around 10 and a half hours. Some people chose to complete the entire hike in a single day, but others might choose to make shorten the hike to 14 miles (2200 feet of elevation gain) and make Walker Lake their destination. No matter how far up the trail you chose to hike, this is an excellent trail to pack in and camp for one or even multiple nights. Four beautiful lakes are a fisher’s paradise, but also make for a breath-taking sight for any explorer.</p>

                <h2>Things to Know Before You Camp</h2>
            </section>
            <div class="fourth-msg">
                <p>The trailhead for this hike is a great place to set up camp if you want to arrive the night before and get an early start the next day. There is an outhouse on the premise but don’t expect the same luxury once you begin your hike. There aren’t necessarily designated camping spots once you make it to the lakes, but some stretches of ground make for a lot better spot to set up a tent than others.</p>
                <p>It is important to know that this is Bear Country, and you will need to put all your food items and anything else that smells in a bear bag and hang it up a tree each night as you get ready for bed. Remember that a bear bag should be raised 15 feet from the ground and be about 10 feet away from the trunk of the tree.</p>
                <p>Although some of the camping spots might have fire pits, fires aren’t allowed all times of the year. It is important for you to do your research before you start your hike to see whether the National Forest Service is permitting fires in the area while you will be camping.</p>
