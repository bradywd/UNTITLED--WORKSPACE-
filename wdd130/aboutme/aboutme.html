    <h2>Brady Dunn</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Brady Dunn. I grew up in Rexburg. I have been married to my wife for a year and a half. We are both still students, and I am studying accounting. </p>
    <p>I currently work as a student employee in the accounting office. I enjoy downhill skiing, hiking, camping, and playing tennis. I don't know anything about web design but am excited to learn a lot in this class. </p>
    <p>I was born into the church. One of my favorite scriptures is 2 Nephi 4:16.</p>
